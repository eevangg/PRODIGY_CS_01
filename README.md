This program works as a **Caesar Cipher encoder/decoder**.

**Steps**
1. The user is prompted to select a mode, _encryption or decryption_.
2. The user is then prompted to input the _message_ to be encrypted/decrypted.
3. The user is then prompted to input the _shift_ value (shifting each letter in the message by the value).
4. The original and new text is then displayed.
